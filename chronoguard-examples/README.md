# ChronoGuard Examples

This module contains example code demonstrating how to use ChronoGuard in various scenarios.

**Note:** This module is for demonstration purposes only and is not published to Maven Central.

## Examples Included

- **CacheTest** - Testing cache expiration with time manipulation
- **TokenExpirationTest** - Testing JWT/token expiration scenarios

## Running the Examples

These examples are meant to be read as reference code. They use mock services and Spring Boot stubs, so they won't run as-is without a proper application context.
